# Project scope:

The students develop a concept for an analytics solution to address a 
problem or opportunity faced by the partnering organization. Our partner in 2024 is M Room 
(www.mroom.com). M Room is a data-driven barber shop chain that specializes in men’s haircuts and 
grooming services. 

Based on the provided data, it is the students’ task to identify the problem or opportunity to be addressed with 
analytics. The only limitations are that the students should be able to (a) demonstrate the benefits of 
addressing the problem or opportunity, and (b) the proposed solution should contain an analytics 
component (e.g., causal inference, machine learning) and explain how the analytics would be applied 
to generate value. 

# Project delivery:
